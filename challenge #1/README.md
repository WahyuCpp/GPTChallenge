Challenge: Dynamic Array Manipulation Using Pointers
Objective:
Create a C++ program that dynamically allocates an array using pointers, allows the user to input values, finds the maximum and minimum values in the array, and then deallocates the memory properly.

Requirements:
1. Use pointers to allocate memory dynamically for an integer array.
2. Allow the user to input N numbers into the array.
3. Implement a function that finds the maximum and minimum values in the array using pointers.
4. Properly deallocate the memory after use to prevent memory leaks.

Bonus Challenge:
1. Implement a resizable array: If the user enters more numbers than the allocated size, reallocate memory dynamically.
2. Sort the array using pointer-based bubble sort instead of array indexing.
